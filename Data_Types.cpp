/*

Variables are what allows the program to store and manipulate data i.e position of a sprite in a game.

Data as variables are stored in the stack or the heap, within the memory.

Primitive data types are the building blocks of data types in memory,
they have specific purposes but we can use it not for those purposes.

The only distinction type is their size.

int: Whole number data type, 4 Bytes large (8b per Byte, 32b in total, compiler dependent), ranges from -(2^31) <--> (2^31 - 1).
unsigned int: int data type but can only exist as an absolute/positive whole number, range from 0 <--> 2^32.
char: Characters, 1B of data, can be assigned as character or number
short: 2B of data
long: 4B of data (Compiler dependent)
long long: 8B of data
